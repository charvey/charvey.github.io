The game of Hangman has two opposing sides. One side picks a word or phrase and the other tries to guess it using only a certain amount of clues.

Points to make
* Each side has different objectives
* Information revealed at the beginning (blanks)
* Information revealed at each turn
* Clues are limited not guesses
* What hidden text is allowed (word, phrase, sentence, proper noun, language, etc.)
* **Determine what is important**
